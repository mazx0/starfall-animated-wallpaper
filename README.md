# starfall-animated-wallpaper
starfall is live wallpaper for **Lively Wallpaper**. 
This is a custom iteration of the Minimalistic Starfall wallpaper, [https://www.rocksdanister.com/] originally created by Rocksdanister .

I took the core logic of the Minimalistic Starfall and significantly enhanced it:
* **Parallax Integration:** Added `parallax.js` logic for 3D depth.
* **Lively Adaptation:** Rewrote the code to work seamlessly with Lively Wallpaper settings.
* **Code Refinement:** Optimization and custom motion features by **Maxim Gerashenko**.
